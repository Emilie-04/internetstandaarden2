        The stories that years later still haunt us, make our brains turn and
        send chills down our spines. We bring up the gruesome details left
        behind on the crime scenes, try to get into the minds, thoughts and
        lives of the people involved.
      </p>

        We go deep, leave no stone unturned, and most importantly leave no
        detail out trying to solve these cases. Join us in this chilling podcast
        where we unravel cases of the past, whether it's unsolved murders or
        people who disappeared and were never heard from again. We talk about
        the impact of these dark cases on the victims and their family, inform
        you and take you with us through this journey while sending stone-cold
        shivers down your spine. Buckle up with us to solve crime left in the
        dark.
